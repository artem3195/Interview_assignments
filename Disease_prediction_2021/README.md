# Disease_prediction model. 

## Description 
This homework assignment for a machine learning engineer position from one of US insurance companies was designed as a Kaggle competition. In this competition I took second place and received an offer.  I explore the data, generate features and train multiclass classification models. This model predicts the probabilities of possible diseases for every client. I was required to maximize AUC ROC score as a key metric. I also find thresholds to make final decisions about possible diseases. With these thresholds we label diseases with 1 if the probability is higher than threshold and 0 otherwise. These thresholds were chosen to maximize  AUC ROC.
