# Damage prediction 

## Description 
This homework assignment was made for one North American AI company which works closely with insurance companies.  I was required to explore the data and predict the building damage category from future wildfires. In this notebook I did a great research of the data, generated new features to better describe training samples working with geo data and trained XGBoost multiclass classification model and 5 XGBoost One VS Rest models for each class of damage respectively.
